# Ethereum_DEX_Data

This repository conducts research using data from Decentralized Exchange(DEX), with a particular focus on UniSwap V3. We are interested in the market microstructure of DEXs, specifically on how 
the beliefs and risk aversion of liquidity providers affects the price of the traded asset.

## Arbitrage Index

This contains the arbitrage index, that indicates the expected profit of executing arbitrage trading between DEXs. However, this does not take into account many factors such as competition and 
price imapct of trade. This is simply an index that captures the difference in price of a single pair from different DEXs.
